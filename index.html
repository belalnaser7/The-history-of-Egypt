            <h4 id="list-item-1">Item 1</h4>
            <p >Because of the length of these ages, researchers have divided them into three eras 
                (the lower, middle and upper Palaeolithic period). Researchers have found the effects of the first period 
                (2300000-100000 BC) in the Egyptian deserts, or in the hills near the valley, and they consist of stone axes, some of which are polished. 
                So that the ax has three faces and its general shape is hierarchical. As for the traces of the Middle Stone Age (100000-35000 BC) in Egypt, 
                most of them were in the form of chips representing blades, with small geometries,
                 and it is worth noting that researchers did not find the skeletons of the human being.
                  He lived in Egypt in the two preceding periods, and with regard to the Upper Paleolithic Age (35000-12000 BC),
                   his traces were discovered in southern Egypt.</p>
            <h4 id="list-item-2">Item 2</h4>
            <p>This era extends from 12000 to 8000 BC, and is considered a transitional stage between the Upper Paleolithic Age and the Neolithic Age,
                 and its effects included small, sharp, stone tools. The same different geometric shapes that prevailed in the previous era</p>
            <h4 id="list-item-3">Item 3</h4>
            <p>This era in Egypt extends from 8000 to 3200 BC, and man's civilization innovations have multiplied and varied in this era, 
                so that it can be said that a multi-faceted civilization revolution took place in this era, as the drought in the ancient Arab East became a reality,
                 which pushed the human being to The creativity of agriculture in order to provide his own food, because nature has become unable to provide food for him, 
                 and therefore man migrated from the deserts to the sedimentary plain on both sides of the Nile and the Delta, after the Nile took the shape of its current
                  course since about 14000 BC, and agriculture forced him to establish a dwelling beside planting it And from the gathering of dwellings, villages and cities arose,
                   and his surplus harvest drove him to create pottery to preserve it. Thus, the disciplines arose and the workshops for the production of pottery, agricultural tools 
                   and ornamental tools were established, which led to the emergence of crafts, and finally it is necessary to refer to the emergence of management in this era, 
                   and the existence of early administration in Egypt helped two main factors: The first is the need of the agricultural community for security that preserves its crops.
                 It is the futility of the absurd, and the second is natural, which is surrounding Egypt with two barren deserts, which man cannot bypass.</p>
